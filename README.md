# Deep Multiple Functional Index Model

We present a PyTorch implementation of deep multiple functional index model.
The work is based on "Deep Learning for Functional Data Analysis with Adaptive Basis Layers" of Yao, Junwen, Jonas Mueller, and Jane-Ling Wang at ICML 2021.
The main contributions of this repo are two fold:
- Generalize to multiple covariates the previous work,
- Add a transformation layer of the inputs based on TransformerEncoder.

  
The Deep Functional Multiple Model (DFMM) is a supervised classification model. The input is m functional covariables (here m=80) and the output is K classes (here K=4).
Paper coming soon...
