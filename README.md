# Deep Multiple Functional Index Model

We present a PyTorch implementation of deep multiple functional index model.
The work is based on "Deep Learning for Functional Data Analysis with Adaptive Basis Layers" of Yao, Junwen, Jonas Mueller, and Jane-Ling Wang at ICML 2021.
The main contribution of this repo is two fold:
- Generalize to multiple covariates the previous work
- Add a transformation layer of the inputs based on TransformerEncoder.
